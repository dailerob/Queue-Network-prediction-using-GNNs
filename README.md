Queue Network Distribution Prediction using Graph Convolutional Neural Networks

Abstract—Predicting queueing network behavior is a necessary 
process for designing and operating queueing networks. Recently, 
Graph Neural Network (GNN) approaches such as RouteNet, have 
been developed with high success at estimating point estimates of 
queue performance. However, these models are often limited to 
point estimates and none so far have provided an estimate of the 
full state distribution of each queue within the queueing network. 
In this paper I addresses these limitations by using a Graph Neural 
Network on generalized queue networks to predict the distribution 
of the number of jobs for each node in a queueing network.
